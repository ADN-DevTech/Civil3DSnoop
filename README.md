This tool uses .NET Reflection to list all properties of AutoCAD Civil 3D major objects, such as Alignments, Corridors, Surfaces, Networks, etc. It also lists collections items and allows selection of objects on-screen.

# Setup

Open the [SnoopCivil3D.sln](Civil3DSnoopDB.bundle\Contents\Source\SnoopCivil3D\SnoopCivil3D.sln) on Visual Studio 2015.

Build the project in Release, the DLL should be placed at /Contents/R23.1 folder. Copy the entire .bundle folder to <b>c:\Program Files\Autodesk\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins</b> folder and launch Civil 3D.

# Usage

### Limitations

The tool uses Reflection to list the properties, so it may not work well for all properties. Most properties should work fine.
